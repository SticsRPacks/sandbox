## Welcome !

If you are a newcomer in the development of R packages or more specifically to the `SticsRPacks` community, this repository is for you. It was specifically created to help new people to learn the basis of all tools used around R packages development.

This tutorial is itself an R package in disguise, so we can use it as a support for learning. There are three main steps to follow, all written as vignettes: 

* How to make an [R package from scracth](articles/make-a-package.html)  
* How to [use GIT and GITHUB](articles/use-git-and-github.html)  
* What is [continuous integration](articles/continuous-integration.html) and how to use it  

You should follow these steps in order to start learning all about R package development.


## Summary workflow

If you already completed the tutorials, you may find a summary of the workflow usefull. For others, you can see that a set of few commands is used in the end, so go to the first tutorial [here](docs/articles/make-a-package.html) to learn what they do!

In summary, here are the steps to follow once everything is set up: 

1. Make a branch  
1. Modify the code or add new functions  
1. Update the documentation (`ctrl+shift+D`)  
1. Update the website (`pkgdown::build_site()`)
1. Build the package (`ctrl+shift+B`) and the vignettes (`devtools::build_vignettes()`) 
1. (optional) Run the CRAN checks locally (`ctrl+shift+E`)  
1. (optional) Run the unit tests locally (`ctrl+shift+T`)  
1. Commit your changes using Github desktop  
1. Publish your branch and make a pull request using Github desktop  
1. Control the CI tools outputs
1. Wait for the review

And voilà!
