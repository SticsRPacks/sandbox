Welcome !
---------

If you are a newcomer in the `SticsRPacks` community, this repository is for you. It was specifically created to help new people to learn the basis of all tools used in the project.

The first thing to learn is how to use GIT and GITHUB.

GIT and GITHUB
--------------

GIT is a software designed for efficient version control. It helps you and your collaborators develop better softwares. With GIT, you can save "snapshots" of your work at any moment, and return to a previous state whenever you want. GIT has much more to offer, but this is out of the scope of this introduction.

### GIT basis

You'll need some basis on GIT before training on this repository. A first reading that is well adapted to our example is [the book of Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html). It explains well the basis of GIT in conjunction with R. There are also several tutorials on the internet for begginers:

-   [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
-   [Git Gud, web based simulator](https://nic-hartley.github.io/git-gud)
-   [Udacity free MOOC](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775#?autoenroll=true)
-   [Github tutorial](https://lab.github.com/)
-   [openclassrooms course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/2342361-gerez-votre-code-avec-git-et-github) (in french only).

A good way to start is also to read the [GIT book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), that is made for everybody from beginners to advanced users.

### Clone the sandbox repo

The next step after learning GIT is to use this example. To do so, follow these simple steps:

1.  Download [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) and install it.
2.  Download and install [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), for Windows or Mac, an app that will help you use GIT. For linux, follow [this link](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases), or install [GitAhead](https://gitahead.github.io/gitahead.com).
3.  Create an account on [Github](https://github.com/).
4.  Open Github desktop, and set your personal informations to connect to your `Github.com` account.
5.  On Github desktop, go to `File`, clone repository, or press `ctrl+shift+O`. And then click on `URL`, and enter this address:

    ``` html
    https://github.com/SticsRPacks/sandbox.git
    ```

    Then, choose where the repository will be cloned (copied) into your computer.

> People that already are members of the SticsRPacks organisation may find the repository directly in the "Github.com" tab.

Congratulations, you just cloned the sandbox repository onto you computer! Now you can see all files in your computer by opening the corresponding folder (`ctrl+shift+F`).

R package format
----------------

An R package needs several mandatory files and folders:

-   `DESCRIPTION`: this file describes the package (name, authors...)
-   `NAMESPACE`: this file lists the functions
-   `R` folder: the folder that contains all R code
-   `man` folder: the folder that contains all the help pages of the package
-   `.Rbuildignore`: the file that tells R which files are excluded from the package build

And some are not mandatory but helpful:

-   `LICENSE`: the license under which the project is developed on.
-   `README.Rmd`: A text file that explains the project to humans using the Rmarkdown format. When knited, this file produces the `README.md` file that is rendered by Github on the main page. This very page is a `README.md` page that is rendered by Github, and that was created using a `README.Rmd` file.
-   `README.md`: the file rendered by Github in the main page of the repository and that aims at explaining the project objectives.
-   `.gitignore`: the file that tells GIT which files to ignore.

Most of these files are automatically generated using specific tools that are described further.

Package example
---------------

Before doing this tutorial, you need to:

1.  Download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
2.  Download and install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
3.  Download and install the tools to build the package:
    -   [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) if you have a windows machine
    -   `XCode` from the AppStore if you have a mac
    -   `r-base-dev` on linux
4.  Use this command line on R to download these packages:

``` r
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr","usethis"))
```

### Open the Rstudio project

Double-click on the `sandbox.Rproj` file. It will open the Rstudio project. From the `Files` window, open the R folder. You will find here all the R scripts used for the package. It is highly encouraged to put each function in a separate file, unless they are very short and can be grouped under a common file with a title that describes well their purpose.

### Simple function

Click on the [`add.r`](R/add.r) file. This file contains one function: `add_x()`. This function simply adds the input to itself. You can see that it is preceded by some text formatted as follows: `#' Text`. This text is a Roxygen documentation. It is formated on a special way that helps R generate the package documentation.

### Documentation

The help pages of each function in a R package are generated by `roxygen2`. To learn more about function documentation read [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html), and to learn more about the format of the documentation read [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html) and [this one](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/formatting.html).

Markdown can be used optionally in Roxygen documentation. To use it, execute the following line once:

``` r
# install.packages("roxygen2md")
usethis::use_roxygen_md()
```

### Build the package

Now that you have the package on your computer, you can build the documentation for all your functions by pressing `ctrl+shift+D`, or by going on the `Build` tab on the upper-right and by clicking on `More`&gt;`Document`. This uses Roxygen to build the help pages from the documentation you write above your functions. The help pages are written in `.Rd` files on the `man` folder of the package. Do not edit these files manually.

You can finally build and install your package by going on the `Build` tab on the upper-right, and by clicking on the `Install and Restart` button (or press `ctrl+shift+B`). This step build the package into your computer.

Now execute this command to access the help page of the function:

``` r
?add_x
```

The help page of the function should pop-up.

### Add a function

Add the following code to the R script:

``` r
add_xy= function(x,y){
  x+y
}
```

This function adds x to y and return the result. Your R script should look like this now:

``` r
#' Add once
#'
#' @description Adds the input to itself
#'
#' @param x Double or Integer
#'
#' @return x+x
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' add_x(2)
#'
add_x= function(x){
  x+x
}

add_xy= function(x,y){
  x+y
}
```

To add the documentation to your function, place your cursor into the function, click on the magic wand just above your script and choose `Insert Roxygen Skeleton`, or press `ctrl+shift+alt+R`. This will create a dummy Roxygen documentation above your function using the arguments of your function. Your function should look like this now:

``` r
#' Title
#'
#' @param x 
#' @param y 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
add_xy= function(x,y){
  x+y
}
```

Fill the documentation such as:

``` r
#' Add x to y
#'
#' @param x Double or integer
#' @param y Double or integer
#'
#' @return x+y
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' add_xy(2,3)
add_xy= function(x,y){
  x+y
}
```

Then re-build your documentation (`ctrl+shift+D`), and re-build your package (`ctrl+shift+B`). You should have access to your own function help page:

``` r
?add_xy
```

Test your functions
-------------------

After writing a new function or modifying one, it is important to test it. This step is mandatory, because some other functions may call this function you wrote, and it becomes more and more difficult to know where bugs are located when none of the functions were thoroughly tested. There are two steps to test a function. The first one is to test it by yourself when designing it, and the other one is by adding automatic tests.

### Manually

When coding a function, you should always test if each line of code in your function is returning the expected result, and if the function returns the correct output after execution. To do so, you can create a separate Rstudio project where you will test your package: go to `File`&gt;`New Project`&gt;`New Directory`&gt;`New Project`, type your project name and choose where it will be located on your computer. The project name is usually taken as the R package name followed by "test", such as `SticsOnR_test`. This step is not mandatory but strongly advised.

After creating the new project, add a new R script (`ctrl+shift+N`), load your R package such as:

``` r
library(SticsOnR)
```

And test your function by giving different inputs and checking the function outputs.

### Automatically

Manual tests are a good first step to evaluate a function, but users tend to test their functions once only, and to skip the tests when making a small change. But this methodology can make the code break for everybody, which is not desirable.

Here enters the automatic tests, or unit tests. These tests are written once, and executed each time the code of the package is pushed to `github.com`, or every time the user needs to. These tests are implemented by using the `testthat` package. All documentation is available on the [package website](https://testthat.r-lib.org/).

To add unit tests to our example function (or to a set of functions), run this command:

``` r
usethis::use_test("add")
```

If you add tests on your package for the first time, the `usethis::use_test()` command will create all the infrastructure you need, if not, it will just create a new test script to your tests.

Now a new folder appeared in our project: `tests`, which contains two things:

-   A subfolder called `testthat` that contains all tests scripts you created.

-   An R script called `testthat.R`. This script will call all tests in the R scripts located in `testthat`. Do not mind this script, you will probably never have to modify it.

If you executed the previous command, you should have a unit test script called `test-add.R` in this directory with the following code:

``` r
context("test-add")

test_that("multiplication works", {
  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
})
```

This test is an example that tests if `2 * 2` is equal to `4`. Change the code to the following to test our function:

``` r
context("test-add")

test_that("add_x returns right output", {
  expect_equal(add_x(1), 2)
})
```

This code tests that `add_x(1)` returns `2`. To run the test, go to the `Build` tab, and choose `Test Package`, or press `ctrl+shift+T`. The tests will all be executed, and a report will appear on the `Build` tab at the end, showing which tests were successfull, and which failed or returned warnings.

You should add different tests for each of your functions, to check if they work correctly, and if they handle errors properly.

More details about unit tests with `testthat` are given [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html).

### CRAN tests

The `devtools` package that you installed previously adds also the tests that CRAN do on all packages. These tests consists on checking that all mandatory files are present, that functions are well documented, etc... It is very important to check the package regularly for errors so the users can download a functionning package. To start a CRAN check, go to the `Build` tab, press the `More` button, and choose `Check Package`, or simply use `ctrl+shift+E`. The package will be checked, and a report will be given at the end.

Share your changes
------------------

### Commit

Each time you modify the package, you should commit your changes to GIT. It is good practice to commit whenever a little step has been reached so the commit message is short enough but still explains everything you did. This methodology make more commits, but is still preferred because it is easier to find changes in the history earlier. So do not hesitates to split your work into little commits.

To commit your changes, open `Github desktop` and choose the repository. The files that were modified in the repository appear in the left-most window, and the associated code that was added or removed should appear in the window on the right. The code in green was added, and the code in red was removed. To commit those changes, enter a commit message in the left window next to your account image, where it is written `Summary (required)`. The message should be concise but should describe all the changes. Then press `Commit to master`. Your changes are commited to the master branch and saved on your computer.

### Push

Whenever your work is done, or you go for lunch, you should push all your commits to github.com. To do so, just press the `Push origin` button in the center or in the upper window. Github desktop will send the changes to github.com, and they should appear in the repository.

Make a website
--------------

A website can be automatically generated from the helpfiles of the R package, the vignettes and the `README.md` file by using the `pkgdown` package. For example the auto-generated website for the `SticsOnR` package is available [here](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/SticsOnR/).

To set up the website, simply execute the following code each time you update the package:

``` r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

When first called, the function creates a new folder called `docs` where it puts all the `html` files for the website. When pushed to github.com, a website is created from these files if you authorized github pages.

To authorize github pages, go to the project page on the repository, then go to `settings`&gt;`Github Pages`&gt;`Source` and then choose `master branch /docs folder`.

The website will be at an address of the form (<https://sticsrpacks.github.io/%7Bpackagename%7D/>), for example our project is rendered at this adress: <https://sticsrpacks.github.io/sandbox/>

Badges, CI and code coverage
----------------------------

### Badges

Badges, or shields allows a quick look to the status of a repository at a given moment. For example there is a badge that shows which licence the repository uses. This badge can be found on [shields.io](https://shields.io/#/examples/license), and more are available from the [main page](https://shields.io) of this website or from other websites. For example, the project status is an interesting information for new users: [![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active).

The badges are often integrated in the head of the README file so users can see the repository status directly.

### CI

There are some interesting external tools that can be used to enhance collaboration. For example the package CRAN checks and unit tests can be run online each time a push has been done to github.com. This is called continuous integration, or CI. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com) are two well-known tools for CI. The first one is used to test the package on linux, and the second one on windows. To set up automatic tests online, you need to link the package to these services, and to add configuration files for each one. You can do so only if you have the required rights on the project.

First, add the configuration files to the repository:

``` r
usethis::use_travis()
usethis::use_appveyor()
```

The first command creates a `.travis.yml` file in the project root, and the second one the `appveyor.yml`. These files are configuration files for each service. Each command execution gives you a link that you can copy and paste in your `README.md` file such as on this README. This link will add a badge that indicates the status of the build on each service. For example here is the badge for TRAVIS-CI: [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/SticsRPacks/sandbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SticsRPacks/sandbox).

If you have the rights, then you can go to the services to set up the CI as described below.

#### Travis-CI

Go to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), sign in with your github account, go to your repositories [here](https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories), choose the `SticsRPacks` organization, and activate the repository.

#### AppVeyor

Go to [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com), sign in with your github account, and choose the repository [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/projects/new).

### Code coverage

The code coverage is a statistic that express how many functions are tested in a project. This is very useful to control the code quality of a repository at a glance. To set up code coverage, you can use the service from [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/), and set it up like the CIs.

First, install the `covr` package:

``` r
install.packages("covr")
```

And then set the configuration file:

``` r
usethis::use_coverage()
```

And then, you'll have to add a line of code on the Travis-CI configuration file to make Travis-CI build the report of coverage. Please modify your `.travis.yml` file such as:

``` yaml
# R for travis: see documentation at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r

language: R
sudo: false
cache: packages
r_github_packages:
  - r-lib/covr
after_success:
  - Rscript -e 'covr::codecov()'
```

You can add the badge to your README, such as: [![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/SticsRPacks/sandbox/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/SticsRPacks/sandbox?branch=master).

Finally, go to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/), log in with your github account, and activate the repository.

Licence
-------

To use a licence, the easier way is to use the dedicated functions from `usethis`. There are four licences available from this package: MIT, GPL3, APL2 and CC0. [This website](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) can help you choose your licence according to your needs.

To set the licence to GPL v3, simply execute this line of code:

``` r
usethis::use_gpl3_license(name = "STICS Group")
```

It will create the licence file, add it to the `DESCRIPTION` file of your package, and add it to `.Rbuildignore`.

Summary
-------

In summary, after everything is set up, here is the steps to follow:

1.  Modify the code or add new functions
2.  Update the documentation (`ctrl+shift+D`)
3.  Update the website (`pkgdown::build_site()`)
4.  Build the package (`ctrl+shift+B`)
5.  (optional) Run the CRAN checks locally (`ctrl+shift+E`)
6.  (optional) Run the unit tests locally (`ctrl+shift+T`)
7.  Commit your changes using Github desktop
8.  Push your commits to github.com
9.  Control the badges to check that the package builds correctly on AppVeyor and Travis-CI
